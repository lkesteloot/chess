- Where this stands now:
    - Chess program understands UCI protocol.
    - The "match" script runs two git versions against one another.
        - % cd test
        - % ant -f .. && ./match chess1 chess2
    - Configure the length of matches and moves in Match.java.
    - I tried adding some things in chess2 and chess3 that should have improved play
        quite a bit, but made little difference in matches. This made me wonder how hard
        it'll be in general to test new changes.
- What to do next:
    - We generate all moves, then weed out the illegal ones (puts in in check), then
        try them. But alpha-beta cutoff probably gets rid of a bunch of them and
        we needlessly checked for legality. Just do it inside the loop. The profiler
        said that half the time was spent checking legality here.
    - I don't quite understand the alpha-beta function as I've written it.
        - Why do we have "color" in search?
    - In iterative deepening, pass on PV to subsequent passes.
    - Add transposition table.
- Surface exceptions in sub-processes.
    - Read from stderr, especially after problem.
- If interrupted search found a result and it's greater than previous alpha, pick it.
- Modify UCI to be multi-threaded.
    - Pass along info as it's happening.
    - Allow stop command.
- Look through saved screenshots, make FEN regression tests for each.
    - Really slow end-of-game when mate is in sight. Why is it so slow? A-B cutoff not working?
    - 4Q3/7P/8/8/8/2k3PK/8/3q4 w KQkq - 1 2
- Sort promotions higher.

    Why are draws so lobsided? [Fixed]
    Why are wins mostly for Black? Wasn't happening with 1000ms moves.
